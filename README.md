## How to run
1. Place `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Choose a domain → Click "Generate Roadmap". Optionally download the roadmap or save your preference in the browser.

## Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no backend)
- Easy to extend with APIs (IBM SkillsBuild, Coursera) and backend storage

## Customize
Edit the `DOMAINS` object in `script.js` to add/change domains, steps, certifications or roles.

## Notes
For a production prototype, consider:
- Adding real course links and API data
- Exporting PDF roadmaps (jsPDF)
- Adding user accounts and storing preferences on server/db
